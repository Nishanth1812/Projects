1st agent 

gets content from the repo using the user's pat and then stores it in a temp local folder
the agent will not get random cache / model/ gitignore type files 

it will have another tool which it will use to commit / update the readme into the repo

it will use a custom tool to get the files and store it in the local folder 

2nd agent 

analyse the files from the folder and generate a file wise summary 

3rd agent 

use all these summaries and then create a proper readme for that repo (it should be proper)


they will work as a team and will have shared context
