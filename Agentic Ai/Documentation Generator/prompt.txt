Project Context:
You are designing the frontend UI for Docu Sage, an intelligent documentation automation platform built using CrewAI agents. The platform automatically generates, maintains, and explains technical documentation for projects using AI. The UI should reflect sophistication, trustworthiness, and innovation — aimed at developers, startups, and teams managing technical codebases.

🎯 Primary Intent:

Create a multi-page, interactive, and visually modern web interface for Docu Sage that looks like a polished SaaS product. It should feel professional and cutting-edge, yet remain lightweight and intuitive.

The UI must be aesthetically elegant, responsive, and feature seamless page transitions, consistent styling, and meaningful micro-animations.

📄 Required Pages (Minimum 4):

Home Page (Landing)

Hero section with project name “Docu Sage” and tagline (“Automate Documentation. Amplify Intelligence.”).

CTA buttons: “Get Started”, “View Docs”, “Try Demo”.

Visual element such as AI illustration, gradient wave, or abstract data visualization.

Quick feature highlights (e.g., “CrewAI Agents”, “Auto-Generated Docs”, “Version Tracking”).

Dashboard Page

Displays active projects and generated documentation summaries.

Cards for “Recent Runs”, “Active Agents”, “Pending Tasks”.

Sidebar or top navbar with navigation links to Home, Dashboard, About, and Auth pages.

Include status indicators and progress components (like bars or circular loaders).

A section that can later integrate with backend endpoints for project data.

About Page

Clearly explain what Docu Sage does, who it’s for, and why it exists.

Subsections:

Our Mission: One paragraph on automating and improving documentation quality.

How It Works: Overview of CrewAI integration and intelligent document generation.

Technology Stack: Icons or tags for Flask, CrewAI, GitHub API, LLMs, etc.

Contact/Feedback: Simple form (Name, Email, Message) or a GitHub link.

Authentication Pages

Login and Register pages for GitHub Personal Access Token authentication.

Modern form layout (centered card, input fields with icons).

Mention that tokens will be validated securely via backend; no direct storage in frontend.

Include subtle success/error toasts and gentle input validation animations.

🎨 Design Language & UI Tone:

Aesthetic: Minimalist, futuristic, and trustworthy.

Color Palette: Deep navy (#0A0F24), violet accent (#6C63FF), soft gradients (violet → blue).

Typography: Use Inter, Sora, or Poppins — modern, sans-serif, and readable.

Layout: Clean grid structure with balanced white space.

Effects:

Smooth hover transitions on buttons and links.

Glassmorphism for cards or modals (slightly transparent backgrounds).

Animated route transitions (fade/slide between pages).

Soft drop shadows, no harsh contrasts.

⚙️ Functional Requirements:

Navigation:

Persistent top navbar or sidebar with links to all pages.

Active route highlighting.

Smooth scroll or fade transitions.

Responsiveness:

Must work perfectly across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Use flexible grid or flexbox layouts.

Component Reuse:

Define reusable UI components: Button, Card, Modal, Navbar, FormInput.

Maintain a consistent spacing, radius, and typography scale system.

Optional Enhancements:

Framer Motion or GSAP for subtle transitions.

Dark/light theme toggle.

Animated loader for async operations.

🧩 Implementation Expectations:

Deliver clean, well-structured frontend code (HTML/CSS/JS or React + Tailwind preferred).

Organize files clearly:

/index.html (Home)

/dashboard.html

/about.html

/login.html

/register.html

/style.css

/app.js

Avoid heavy frameworks unless necessary. Keep it fast and lightweight.

Include comments to mark page sections and reusable elements.

✨ Output Goal:

Produce a multi-page, visually consistent, and production-ready frontend that captures the intelligence, precision, and elegance of an AI-driven product.
The result should make a strong first impression while feeling natural to navigate — something you could confidently show in a live demo. save the files in the glm4.6 folder of frontend_test folder
