Here's your **polished, professional, and compact `README.md`** with improved formatting and a better-styled Maintainer section. I’ve removed the `requirements.txt` and the To-Do list as you requested, and made the final section more elegant and personal.

# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection with MRI Scans

A deep learning project for classifying brain tumors using MRI images. Includes a custom-built CNN model and a standard Keras implementation, trained and evaluated on Kaggle’s **Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection** dataset.

---

## 📁 Dataset Structure

```
Dataset/
└── Data/
    ├── yes/
    └── no/
```

> Each subfolder contains `.jpg` MRI scans, labeled as `yes` (tumor) or `no` (no tumor).

---

## ⚙️ Preprocessing & Augmentation

Before executing the scripts, manually create these folders:

### 🔹 Preprocessing
```
Preprocessed Data/
├── yes/
└── no/
```
Then run:
```bash
python "Image Preprocessing.py"
```

### 🔹 Augmentation
```
Augmented Data/
├── yes/
└── no/
```
Then run:
```bash
Augmentation.ipynb
```
