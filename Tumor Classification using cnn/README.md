Heck yeah! Let’s take this README to the next level with a splash of flair 🎨—adding badges, maybe a GIF for some motion magic, and polishing the look to make it pop like a top GitHub project. Here's the ✨ fully enhanced version:

> “Saving lives, one pixel at a time.”  
A deep learning-based solution to detect brain tumors using MRI scans. The project features two models—a hand-crafted CNN and a Keras-based implementation—evaluated on Kaggle’s **Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection** dataset.

## 📁 Dataset Structure

```
Dataset/
└── Data/
    ├── yes/    ← Tumor-positive MRI scans
    └── no/     ← Tumor-negative MRI scans
```

---

## ⚙️ Preprocessing & Augmentation

💡 Before running the models, prepare the folders manually as shown:

### 🔹 Preprocessing

Create this structure:
```
Preprocessed Data/
├── yes/
└── no/
```
Then run:
```bash
python "Image Preprocessing.py"
```

### 🔹 Augmentation

Create:
```
Augmented Data/
├── yes/
└── no/
```
Then execute:
```bash
Augmentation.ipynb
```

> These steps normalize and diversify the dataset—key for strong model generalization. 🧼📈

## 🤖 Model Implementations

### 🧠 Custom CNN – `Custom_Implementation.ipynb`
Built layer-by-layer using pure TensorFlow/Keras. Great for understanding CNNs at the core.

- ✅ **Accuracy:** ~83%  
- 📊 **F1 Score:** 0.83

---

### ⚙️ Keras Model – `Model_implementation.ipynb`
A Sequential model using Keras. Quick to build, train, and deploy.

- ✅ **Accuracy:** ~85%  
- 📊 **F1 Score:** 0.83–0.84

> 🧪 Both notebooks include plots to visualize model performance (loss, accuracy over epochs).
