# ✋🎚️ Hand Gesture Volume Control

Control your computer's volume with nothing but your fingers! Just pinch your thumb and index finger together to reduce the volume, and spread them apart to pump it back up — no touch, no clicks, just pure gesture magic.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🎯 **Real-Time Hand Tracking**
  Uses your webcam and MediaPipe to track hand gestures with precision.

* 🔊 **Intuitive Volume Control**
  Pinch to lower, spread to raise — it's that simple.

* 📊 **Visual Feedback**
  See live updates of your volume level with an on-screen bar and percentage display.

* 📱 **Phone Camera Support**
  Don’t have a webcam? Use your phone as a wireless camera via IP streaming.

---

## 🛠️ Installation

Install all required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pycaw comtypes requests imutils
```

---

## ▶️ How to Use

1. Launch the application:

   ```bash
   python volume_control.py
   ```

2. Hold your hand in front of the camera.

3. Adjust the distance between your thumb and index finger:

   * 📉 **Pinch** to decrease volume
   * 📈 **Spread** to increase volume

4. Press any key to exit the application.

## 🧠 How It Works

* The app uses **MediaPipe** to detect your hand and track landmarks (fingers).
* It calculates the **distance between your thumb and index finger tips**.
* That distance is then mapped to your system's master volume using **PyCaw** — a Python library for controlling Windows audio.
* All updates are displayed in real time, with a responsive volume bar and percentage counter.

## 📱 Use Phone as Webcam (Optional)

Want to use your phone camera instead of a built-in webcam? Here’s how:

1. Install an IP Webcam app like [IP Webcam (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam) or similar on your phone.
2. Find the IP address shown in the app.
3. In the code, modify this line:

   ```python
   url = "http://YOUR_PHONE_IP:8080/shot.jpg"
   ```
4. Uncomment the section in the script that captures from this URL.
